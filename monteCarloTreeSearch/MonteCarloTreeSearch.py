    In this process, a simulation is performed by choosing moves or strategies until a result or predefined state is achieved.
    
    Continuing from the newly-created node in the expansion phase, moves are selected randomly and the game state is repeatedly advanced. 
    This repeats until the game is finished and a winner emerges. No new nodes are created in this phase.

    This is a good time to remind ourselves that nodes in the search tree correspond to nodes in the game tree. 
    In this phase, we are simply applying the rules of the game to repeatedly (1) find all legal moves in the current game state, 
    (2) choose one legal move randomly, then (3) advance the game state. 
    No part of this process is stored. This phase ends when we reach a state where the game is finished.

    Note: A game played during the simulation phase is either called a simulation or a playout. This may get confusing because one iteration of the whole 4-phase process is also sometimes called a simulation or a playout. Be aware of this and use your discretion to disambiguate.
