## Alpha Zero Chess AI
### Autumn and Fall Project 2022-2023

A repository for Cogito student driven project, AlphaZeroChess. 
This repo will contain out progress and documentation.

## Description - What is the project about?

The AlphaZeroChess project is a study in [Alpha zero](https://www.chess.com/terms/alphazero-chess-engine). The point of the project is learning about different techniques applied in AI. For example the powerful Monte Carlo Tree Search and Neural Networks.

*Most of the people working on this project are new to AI and machine learning, it is a learning experience.*

## Goal - What do we want to achieve?

Since it is an introduction and a **fun** project done at the side of studies, we want to make something realistic but cool at the same time. Our goal at the Alpha Zero Chess project is to construct a self made AI, which is trained on an already existing chess environment.

#### Our goal is to make and train the best chess AI NTNU has seen. 

After we have trained and adjusted our AI, we want to show it off! What we have in mind right now is making a full on playable chess game where you play against our AI. This should be uploaded and playable at our website, and at a stand at Realfagsbygget NTNU. 

## Tech Stack - What are we using?

Here at our project we mainly use Python for code. This is because most of the libraries made for machine learning is compatible with Python. It's also very "beginner friendly".


## How to start.
Open the project and write to terminal:
```
pip install -e .
```
